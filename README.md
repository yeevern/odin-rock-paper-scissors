# Odin Rock Paper Scissors Project

This repository is attempted at creating a rock, paper and scissors game for the Odin Project's foundation course.

This website was created entirely with HTML, Javascript and abit of CSS, with no other frameworks or plugins. The main goal of the project is to demonstrate my understanding of using javascript along with HTML to create a wonderful webpage.
